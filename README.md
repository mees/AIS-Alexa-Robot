This repository contains an Alexa skill to control and interact with a robot via [ROS](https://www.ros.org/) topics. Concretely, the current skill implementation was used for picking-and-placing tabletops objects from natural language. More information at the [project page](http://speechrobot.cs.uni-freiburg.de/).

## Usage

First, launch ``rosbridge_server``:
```
roslaunch rosbridge_server rosbridge_websocket.launch
```
In a separate shell, make your local port visible for the VM
```
ssh -R 9090:localhost:9090 aisalexa /opt/aisalexa/forward_port.sh
```
In case your local server does not run on port 9090, replace the first port number only.

There will be three ros topics: ``/alexa/command``, ``alexa/debug`` and ``alexa/reply``. See
[test_response.py](test_response.py) for examplary handling of commands.

## Start server

Start all containers
* ``cd /opt/aisalexa/nginx``
* ``sudo ./start.sh``

Show container logs
* ``cd /opt/aisalexa/nginx``
* ``sudo docker-compose logs aisalexa`` (leave out the service name to get the logs of all services)



## Setup

see [Setup](./setup.md)

For configuration, change the environment variables in ``nginx/.env``.

Update configuration by using ``git pull``. When running ``start.sh``,
updated images (i.e., the updated skill) are retrieved automatically.
Remember that changes to the skill must be pushed to ``aisgit`` for
the updated docker container to be built
